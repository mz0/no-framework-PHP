# WTF is a "no-framework PHP MVC"?

Essential code taken from [27.02.2006 "The no-framework PHP MVC framework" by
Rasmus Lerdorf](https://toys.lerdorf.com/archives/38-The-no-framework-PHP-MVC-framework.html)

I could not find this code besides author's page and having difficulty evaluating
author's design decision, decided to assemble it in a runnable form to study that.

Had to add categories.txt, 'items' table creation with correct schema,
and [yui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUI_Library)-0.11.3
([Aug. 2006](http://web.archive.org/web/20180925230201/https://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/08/28/yui-release-113)) files
(2.9.0 also worked but I could not find a reason to keep them)

This PoC works by some definition of work, though UI is creepy, and I can't help but notice that YUI was
[released](http://web.archive.org/web/20180925230201/https://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/02/13/the-yahoo-user-interface-library/)
less then 2 weeks before the "no-framework PHP MVC" post.

The missing 'ctime' field [WTF](https://github.com/mz0/no-framework-PHP/blob/master/model/items.inc#L8)
(missing in author's listing) is a perfect example of misleading (and for this reason undesirable) code comments.

Note: had to `apt install --no-install-recommends php-apcu php5.6-sqlite3` to complement my Ubuntu PHP setup.
Again APC use seems [unjustified and plain ugly](https://github.com/mz0/no-framework-PHP/blob/23e0723e29c234baaf0d0cf70872876c0fc0f361/model/db.inc#L23).
